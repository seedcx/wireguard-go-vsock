# Go Implementation of [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) over VSOCK

This is an implementation of WireGuard in Go with support to [`vsock`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vsock.7.html).

## Usage

Run:

```
$ wireguard-go-vsock wg0
```

This will create an interface and fork into the background. An ephemerous VSOCK port (`VMADDR_PORT_ANY`) will be bound to any VSOCK CID (`VMADDR_CID_ANY`).

To remove the interface, use the usual `ip link del wg0`, or if your system does not support removing interfaces directly, you may instead remove the control socket via `rm -f /var/run/wireguard/wg0.sock`, which will result in wireguard-go shutting down.

To run `wireguard-go-vsock` without forking to the background, pass `-f` or `--foreground`:

```
$ wireguard-go-vsock -f wg0
```

When an interface is running, you may use [`wg(8)`](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/about/src/man/wg.8) to configure it, as well as the usual `ip(8)` and `ifconfig(8)` commands.

To run with more logging you may set the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL=debug`.

Note that this implementation will adopt addresses in the format `vsock://<cid>:<port>` where `cid` is the VSOCK address and `port` the port number. Note that due to certain implementation limitations at the base `wireguard-go`, the port should not be set as 32-bits, but 16-bits instead (as in Internet addresses).

By default, `wireguard-go-vsock` uses `SOCK_STREAM` socket type. If you want to use `SOCK_DGRAM`, just add `-d` to the command line. Just note that `SOCK_DGRAM` isn't supported by every hypervisor, if not supported, you should see `ENODEV` (no such device) at the logs. The `SOCK_STREAM` vsock implementation supports a single connection only, which is the most common use case when dealing with AWS Nitro Enclaves.

## Platforms

### Linux

This will run on Linux with support to `AF_VSOCK` only.

### Other OSes

There is no support yet.

## Building

This requires an installation of [go](https://golang.org) â‰¥ 1.19.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/balena/wireguard-go-vsock
$ cd wireguard-go-vsock
$ make
```
